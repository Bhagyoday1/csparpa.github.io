Summary: A few hints on writing a good CV to promote yourself as a programmer in the SW development industry

Writing a good CV is the key to obtaining your dream job and successfully start/boost your career.  
But if you're a software craftsman, writing a good CV isn't so easy and there is a plenty of
reasons why you should give the maximum relevance to it.  

Please note that in this post I'm talking about CV writing for *technical* positions: this means that the formats won't be
good for management/different kind of positions.

### ...isn't it enough to just write down my previous jobs and my skillset?
**No!** Keep on reading...  

### What a CV really is: selling by differentiating
A CV is an *advertisement*. It exists to blink an eye to potential customers, which in career development
are employers. So the aim of your CV is: have the customers buy yourself.  
And what would you do in order to sell yourself as a product?

1. **Believe in your product**. You're worth your skills, which have been built after years of studies, experience, abnegation. This is something that everyone,
but first of all _you_ must respect.
2. **Present the product in the better possible fashion**. Many facets around that:  

    - have your _good parts_ stand out - so everyone knows what you're good at!
    - be _concrete_: provide facts, numbers, achievements
    - be _concise_ and leave _cliffhangers_: don't tell the whole story! Just provide fundamental facts, but let people come back to you to ask for more detail
    - _never lie about yourself_: if you do, you are doomed to eternal unsuccess. What you need to do, instead, is try to hide as much as possible your weaknesses (in terms of technical, behavioural, organisational debts) or -
even better - to show them under a positive view, as things you're currently keen on improving.
    - let the advertisement be pleasant to the customer's eyes_: the text should be clear and readable. So you need to use proper fonts, sizes, colours and to align contents consistently.
    - double-checking for _typos_ (if you still make grammar mistakes, please go back to school...)

3. **Show your passion and hunger**: show how much _passion_ and _commitment_ you put into the things you've made/built/worked on! This conveys your emotional status to the people so they can feel your enthusiasm. And also let people know that you're not
sitting down and waiting for change to come: give evidence that you _embrace change_, are _proactive_ and _eager to improve yourself and your skills_ in any possible way.
4. **Differentiate your product from the others**: absolutely _avoid being uniformed_. If you become a number, your chances to smash the opponents will dramatically decrease: therefore, always strive to stand out of the crowd by formatting your CV in
a smart and appealing way. This can be achieved using custom structure and graphics, but be careful not to exceed with your imagination...

### A possible CV format
Unless explicitly requested by employers, you should avoid CV formats such as Europass who are meant to standardise candidate profiles
for all potential employers to easily browse through: this is obviously against product differentiation. Besides that, compiling the endless Europass templates is a damn boring task!  

After a bit of experimentation applying to job openings both in Italy and the UK, I've come up with a potentially good CV format (you tell me).  

#### Overview

I personally prefer minimalist CV formats. Keep in mind that there will be a 99% probability that you'll send your CV in PDF format, so don't rely on features that are specific to your word processor.

#### Raw structure

[TBD: explain sections with an eye on SW industry requirements]

#### Styling
- the font is Arial 10 for paragraph text and 12 for titles
- I only use colour black
- I use tables to align content and make their borders invisible
- Sections are clearly identifiable as they are kept separate one from each other
- I use a lot of bullet lists: they're clear and concise

### The cover letter
[TBD: cover letter is the positioning of your advertisement, if you place it to somewhere nobody can see, what's the point in that??]

### Strategies for CV bullet-proofing
1. Write down your CV
2. Write down a proper cover letter
3. Compare both against the job spec and match job spec keywords. If your CV+cover are not matching at least 90% of the job spec's keywords, then you need to change them accordingly
4. Have your CV+cover read by a fellow professional (eg: another developer, an IT manager, etc.)
5. Put yourself in the shoes of a potential employer: would you give a chance to someone with your profile? Sincerely. If the answer is not a full "yes!", then somethig must be changed in your CV+cover.
