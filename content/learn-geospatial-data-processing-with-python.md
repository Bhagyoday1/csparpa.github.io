Summary: A good book about learning how to write Python applications that create beautiful and significant maps through geospatial data processing


Due to my work experience in geospatial applications development, last year I was selected as reviewer for a good introductory book on the topic, and that was a honor to me.

The book is:

[Geospatial Development By Example with Python - ISBN 13: 9781785282355](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/geospatial-development-example-python)

written by [Pablo Carrera](https://www.packtpub.com/books/info/authors/pablo-carreira) and e-printed/printed by Packt Publishing.

I highly recommend this book if you're new to geospatial data processing, GIS, map-oriented applications and things like and you want to learn more about it and use Python in all its glory as the de-facto king language in this sector.

The books is practice-oriented and contains lots of examples - and maps :)
