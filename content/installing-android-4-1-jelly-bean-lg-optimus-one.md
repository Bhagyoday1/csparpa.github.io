Summary: How to install Android 4.1 on LG Optimus One (LG P500)

### A Happy LG Optimus One owner’s story

I’m a happy owner of an LG Optimus One: not only because it proved many times to be a performing device, but also because – a few days after I bought it – I managed to replace the custom Android it had on board (themed by TIM: ugly!!!) with a simple and plain Android 2.2.1 Froyo stock ROM. This I did, despite many warnings I read about phone brick and license invalidation. About six-months after, I had the same fever and replaced Froyo with Gingebread: no problems this time, as well.  

Last monday, after reading that someone ([Android Open Kang Project](http://aokp.co/) team) built an unoffical Android 4.1 Jelly Bean port for LG Optimus One, I took a fancy to it…”Danger is my business” – I thought. So, let’s go replace my current Android with the one on the crest of waves!!!  

I am reporting the steps I followed: they took about 3 hours, considering also the conclusive phone re-configuration and apps re-install.  

Result: a fresh and fluid install on my Optimus One!

### READ THIS: DEATH DANGER ;-)

Please, don’t take what you’re gonna read as a serious guide to modding (you can find tons of forum posts on sites such as xda): the following steps were just conceived to provide a big and fuzzy idea of what it takes to perform such an install, it’s up to you to search for details!
